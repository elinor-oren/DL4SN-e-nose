# Coffe(e-nose) Build Guide

Elinor Oren, link to github repo with project work in / link to Edge Impulse projects

## Materials 


## Step 1 - Build Hardware (Schematic)
- Use the TinyML shield
- Replace the wires in the ribbon cable 

## Step 1 
- Download the library as a zipped file here `https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_MICS/tree/master` and add it to your Arduino Libraries.

## Data Recording + Processing 
- Copy and paste your Serial data into a textfile.
- Open the `script` in a Google Colabs window.
- Update textfile and csv pathways to your desired locations. 

## Model
This is a Deep Learning project! What model architecture did you use? Did you try different ones? Why did you choose the ones you did?

*Tip: probably ~200 words and a diagram is usually good to describe your model!*

## Experiments
What experiments did you run to test your project? What parameters did you change? How did you measure performance? Did you write any scripts to evaluate performance? Did you use any tools to evaluate performance? Do you have graphs of results? 

*Tip: probably ~300 words and graphs and tables are usually good to convey your results!*

## Results and Observations
Synthesis the main results and observations you made from building the project. Did it work perfectly? Why not? What worked and what didn't? Why? What would you do next if you had more time?  

*Tip: probably ~300 words and remember images and diagrams bring results to life!*
